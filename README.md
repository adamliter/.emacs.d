# README

This is a repository for my `~/.emacs.d/` directory. I'm just learning Emacs, so I wouldn't recommend using this for anything. In fact, I have no idea how you got here or why you're reading this. It's probably not worth your time. If you're trying to learn Emacs, you should go somewhere useful, like the [Emacs wiki][1].
